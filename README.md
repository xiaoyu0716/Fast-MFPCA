multi_sparse_mfpca.Rmd is the main code file for the project method. Folder fast_MFPCA_code is the source code for paper "Fast multilevel functional principal component analysis. Journal of Compu-
tational and Graphical Statistics, 32:366â€“377, 2023. ISSN 15372715. doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2115500." It is in need for multi_sparse_mfpca.Rmd since it needs to source several functions.
Folders SemiPar, refund are some relevant packages may use.
Folder code_for _learning is some draft file I wrote while coding, it is possibly useless :)

In the branch paper_refering, I put the papers I read for the projects.
