This folder contains the code of paper "Fast Multilevel Functional Principal Component Analysis."
- The proposed method is implemented in the function mfpca.face(), which is now available in R package refund;
- An example to run mfpca.face() is shown in the file "demo.R";
- The RMD file in the folder "Rmarkdown" provides two examples on the time difference between traditional MFPCA and fast MFPCA under different sizes of the simulated data. The simulation results in the paper were obtained and summarized from 100 replications of each simulation scenario on the JHPCE cluster.
